# Vaccine Informed Consent Knowledge-base (VICK) Graph

** Work in progress **

VICK is an ontology-based knowledge graph extending the Vaccine Informed Consent Ontology (VICO) to facilitate interoperability and exchange of patient-related immunization information. We analyzed a range of immunization-related documents—including HPV vaccine information sheets, consent forms, and immunization registry details—to extract key terms related to the vaccine administration process and HPV. These terms were used to build concept maps that visualize the immunization process and HPV-related cancer risks, highlighting relationships among patients, vaccines, and consent. The resulting maps and ontology structure reflect both procedural and biomedical aspects of vaccination in addition to selected object properties that link key terms.
